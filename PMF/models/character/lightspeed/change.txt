The orgiginal lightspeed files that are not employed by this modified Bayesian program learning (BPL) model have been removed.  
And in the file "mvnormpdfln.m", the lines 90 and 91 have been changed from  
    dx = solve_tril(S',dx);  
    %dx = S'\dx;  
to  
%     dx = solve_tril(S',dx);  
    dx = S'\dx;
